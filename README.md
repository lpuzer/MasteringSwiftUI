# MasteringSwiftUI


This is a repository where I keep some code generated during my studies about the SwiftUI framework . There are codes for navigating between the different pages of the application, codes related to page layout, and codes involving data transfer between different pages.
I also provide a video with the content of the project. The video will be updated as new modules are added to the project.

it's also important to say that all code presented in this repository is based on the book Mastering SwiftUI, written by Simon NG:

All pull requests must include the implementation for router navigating to the desired views. To do this, edit the enum cases at Helper/Page and at PageController as shown in the picture below.
