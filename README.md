# MasteringSwiftUI


This is a repository where I keep some code produceded during my studies about the SwiftUI framework . There are codes for navigating between the different pages of the application, codes related to page layout, and codes involving data transfer between different pages.
I also provide a video with the content of the project. The video will be updated as new modules are added to the project.
