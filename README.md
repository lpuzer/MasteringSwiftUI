# MasteringSwiftUI


This is a repository where I keep some code produceded during my studies about the SwiftUI framework . There are codes for navigating between the different pages of the application, codes related to page layout, and codes involving data transfer between different pages.
I also provide a video with the content of the project. The video will be updated as new modules are added to the project.

Anyone is welcome to contribute any code to the MasteringSwiftUI repository.

it will also be necessary to configure the ViewRouter navigation, adding an enum case regarding the new View into both Helper and PageController, as shown below.
